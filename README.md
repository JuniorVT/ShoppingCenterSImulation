# ShoppingCenterSImulation
 Project from Maastricht University (Bonus Assignment)


This speficific work required more of Java and statistics (matlab) than some of my other projects. 
The project consisted in a supermarket store that needs to know information regarding their 'checkout' process for cash registers and service desk customers.
We know the distribution as well as their working ethic (when they open/close registers, minimum amount of registers, etc).

If you want to know more about this work, or have any questions/recommendations, please make sure to send me an email to jorge.lvt@outlook.com
